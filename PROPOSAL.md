# Final Project Proposoal

I would like to make an OpenCV Maze Solver for my final project. The idea is to have some sort of maze printed onto a piece of paper, have the camera translate it into a matrix, use a search algorithm to solve the maze, and then display the solution through the camera over the maze. If that's not possible, I would like to work on something that is related to OpenCV or maybe a first-person game with OpenGL.

In the past, I've seen many cool computer vision projects, such as a GymCam that tracks people's form when working out and the vehicle counting and classifying project. In high school, I was on a team to build an underwater ROV for a comptetition. One of my teammates was working on an shape classifier to determine what objects to pick up, which I thought was really cool. Before, I was skeptical about taking on an OpenCV project because I wasn't familiar with C++, but now I feel I have enough experience in this language to take on a moderately complex project.

If I were to finish the project early, one stretch goal I would implement is a maze generator algorithm, which would generate a maze and then my maze solving algorithm would solve it. Then, display the maze and the solution on the screen.

**Timeline**

Week 1: 

- Integrate A* algorithm to solve a maze
- Set up OpenCV on machine

Week 2: 

- Test the solver thoroughly
- Use DFS to generate a maze for the solver to solve

Week 3: 

- Test the generator thoroughly
- Implement OpenCV if I have extra time
